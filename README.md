PyNS
====
PyNS is a tiny tool which uses PyQt4 on Python 3 to give a UI for network scanning. This tool is not sophisicated by any means but throws up some interesting information about what unprotected web services you can find on the internet!
Simply type in a start HOST ID such as 255.255.255 and it will start at 255.255.255.0 and iterate through to 255.255.255.255, you can choose to either scan for HTTP or FTP servers on this IP range.

DISCLAIMER: This tool is by no means in a finished state and choosing to run it is at your own risk.
